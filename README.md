## 1. Overview of the Game

The **Number Guessing Game** is a simple game where the player has to guess a random number chosen by the system. The number is between 1 and 100, and the player has a limited number of attempts to guess it. The system provides feedback after each guess, indicating whether the guess was too high, too low, or correct.

## 2. Game Logic

### 2.1 Setting Up the Game

- **Initialize the Game**: Upon starting the game, the user is greeted with a message and prompted to choose a difficulty level.
- **Difficulty Levels**: 
    - Easy: 10 turns
    - Hard: 5 turns

### 2.2 Choosing Difficulty

- **Prompt the User**: Ask the user to type `'easy'` or `'hard'` to choose a difficulty level. The choice determines how many attempts the player has to guess the number.
- **Set the Number of Turns**:
    - For **Easy** difficulty, set the turns to 10.
    - For **Hard** difficulty, set the turns to 5.

### 2.3 Generating a Random Number

- **Random Number Generation**: Once the difficulty is chosen, generate a random number between 1 and 100. This is the number the player has to guess.
- Store the generated number in a variable to compare against the player’s guesses.

### 2.4 User Guess and Feedback

- **User Input**: After the difficulty is chosen, prompt the user to enter their guess. This input is validated as a number.
- **Provide Feedback**: Based on the user’s guess:
    - If the guess is **too low**, inform the user that their guess is too low.
    - If the guess is **too high**, inform the user that their guess is too high.
    - If the guess is **correct**, inform the user that they won the game.

### 2.5 Win or Loss Conditions

- **Win Condition**: The player wins the game if their guess matches the randomly generated number.
    - Display a congratulatory message with the correct number.
    - End the game and stop further guesses.
- **Loss Condition**: The player loses the game if they run out of attempts without guessing the correct number.
    - Display a message telling the player that they have run out of guesses.
    - Reveal the correct number.

## 3. Game Flow

Here’s how the game should flow:

1. **Welcome the User**: Display an introductory message and ask the player to choose a difficulty level.
2. **Choose Difficulty**: Based on the player’s input, set the number of turns to either 10 (Easy) or 5 (Hard).
3. **Generate the Secret Number**: Generate a random number between 1 and 100 for the player to guess.
4. **User Makes a Guess**: After each guess, give feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
5. **Check Win or Loss**: After each guess, check if the player has won or lost.
    - If won, display a win message.
    - If lost (out of turns), display a loss message with the correct number.
6. **End of Game**: The game ends when the player guesses correctly or runs out of attempts.

## 4. Additional Features (Optional)

Here are a few optional features you could add to improve the game:

- **Hints**: Offer the user a hint after a certain number of incorrect guesses, such as saying whether the number is odd or even.
- **Score Tracking**: Keep track of how many games the player has played and their win/loss ratio.
- **Replay Option**: Allow the player to play again after winning or losing without refreshing the page.
- **Visual Enhancements**: Use colors, animations, or sound effects to make the game more interactive and engaging.
